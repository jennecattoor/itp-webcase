## Programs

- Contentful: Easy to use and one of the more popular to use headless CMS systems. I didn't have any experience using Contentful but it was very straightforward.
- Next.js: Very good React-based workflow. I haven't used Next.js before so I had to read the docs to learn about the serverside rendering.
- GraphQl: I had little experience with using GraphQL in a personal project. Easy to learn and get the data you need with GraphiQl.
- Vercel: Straightforward to use for this project as Next.js is from the creator of Next.js.
