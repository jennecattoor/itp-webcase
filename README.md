## General info

- Time programmed: 3h30min
- Time writing content: 30min
- Time reading docs/googling: 2h
- Total Time = ~6h

## Programs

- Contentful: Easy to use and one of the more popular headless CMS systems. I didn't have any experience using Contentful but it was very straightforward.
- Next.js: React-based workflow. Very positive experience, I haven't used Next.js before so I had to read the docs to learn about the serverside rendering.
- GraphQl: I had little experience with using GraphQL in a personal project. Easy to get the data you need with GraphiQL
- Vercel: Straightforward to use for this project as Next.js is from the creator of Next.js.

## Experience

It was a really fun project to do. I went a little over the ~4h mark this is mainly because of having to read documentations. You can always contact me if you have any questions of choices I made or tips to improve.
